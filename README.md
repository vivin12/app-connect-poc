## App Connect Architecture 

IBM App Connect Enterprise processes messages in two ways: message routing and message transformation.

## Message Routing

The message flows that you design control message routing. A message flow describes the operations to be performed on the incoming message, and the sequence in which they are carried out. 

Each message flow consists of the following parts:
- A series of steps used to process a message; see Message flow nodes.
- Connections between the nodes, defining routes through the processing; see Message flow connections.
